            <p>- The game has two players playing in rounds</p>
            <p>- In each turn, a player rolls two dices once which is added to the player's current score by clicking 'ROLL DICE'</p>.
            <p>- When player rolls the dice and he didn't roll a 1, player clickes on 'HOLD' to add to his total score and it's the next player's turn</p>
            <p>- if a player rolls a 1, the player losses his current score, then automatically the next player turn to roll</p>
            <p>- if a player rolls a double 1, the player losses his current score and his total score (GLOBAL), then automatically the next player turn to roll</p>
            <!-- <p>- when a player clickes on HOLD,the player gets his total score (GLOBAL) and it's the next player's turn</p> -->
            <p>- The first player to reach a 100 point wins by default</p>
            <p>- Players can reset the FINAL SCORE to be the default winning score</p>
