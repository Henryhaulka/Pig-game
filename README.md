# Pig-game
In this Project, I built a game with the concept of DOM manipulation for my learning purpose

# RULES
- The game has two players playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as much as he wishes which is added to the player's current score by clicking 'ROLL DICE'.
- if a player rolls a 1, the losses his current score, after that, it's the next player turn
- when a player clickes on HOLD,the player gets his total score (GLOBAL) and it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach a 100 point wins
